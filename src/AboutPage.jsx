        Hello! My name is Chris Fitzgerald. I'm a 19-year-old photographer currently based in New York City, where I study Photography and Imaging at NYU Tisch with a double major in Economics. Originally from Boston, I've explored a wide range of creative workâ€”spanning street and landscape photography, studio portraiture, actors' headshots, conceptual photo series, and short films across genres. Whether I'm behind the camera or in the editing studio, my focus is on using light, color, and composition to tell compelling, emotionally resonant stories. I'm currently seeking freelance photography work and internships in the media, art, or entertainment industries. I'm especially interested in opportunities that allow me to collaborate with others, develop my technical skills, and engage with bold, creative storytelling. Feel free to reach out, I'd love to connect!        </p>
